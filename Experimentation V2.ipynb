    "1 Introduction\n",
    " Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks\n",
    " in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\n",
    " transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous\n",
    " efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\n",
    " architectures [38, 24, 15].\n",
    " Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\n",
    " sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\n",
    " states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\n",
    " sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\n",
    " sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\n",
    " significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\n",
    " computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\n",
    " constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n",
    " Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc\n",
    "tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\n",
    " the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\n",
    " are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n",
    " In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\n",
    " relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\n",
    " The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\n",
    " translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n",
    " 2 Background\n",
    " The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n",
    " [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\n",
    " block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\n",
    " the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\n",
    " in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\n",
    " it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\n",
    " reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\n",
    " to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\n",
    " described in section 3.2.\n",
    " Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\n",
    " of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\n",
    " used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\n",
    " textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n",
    " End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence\n",
    "aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\n",
    " language modeling tasks [34].\n",
    " To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\n",
    " entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence\n",
    "aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\n",
    " self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n",
    " 3 ModelArchitecture\n",
    " Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\n",
    " Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,xn) to a sequence\n",
    " of continuous representations z = (z1,...,zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\n",
    " sequence (y1,...,ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n",
    " [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n",
    " 2\n",
    "Figure 1: The Transformer- model architecture.\n",
    " The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\n",
    " connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\n",
    " respectively.\n",
    " 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n",
    " Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\n",
    " sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position\n",
    "wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\n",
    " the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\n",
    " LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\n",
    " itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\n",
    " layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\n",
    " Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\n",
    " sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\n",
    " attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\n",
    " around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\n",
    " sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\n",
    " masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\n",
    " predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n",
    " 3.2 Attention\n",
    " An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\n",
    " where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n",
    " 3\n",
    "Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n",
    " Multi-Head Attention\n",
    " Figure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\n",
    " attention layers running in parallel.\n",
    " of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\n",
    " query with the corresponding key.\n",
    " 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n",
    " We call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\n",
    " queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\n",
    " query with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\n",
    " values.\n",
    " In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\n",
    " into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\n",
    " the matrix of outputs as:\n",
    " Attention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT\n",
    " √\n",
    " dk \n",
    ")V\n",
    " (1)\n",
    " The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi\n",
    "√\n",
    " plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\n",
    " of 1\n",
    " dk \n",
    ". Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\n",
    " a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\n",
    " much faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\n",
    " matrix multiplication code.\n",
    " While for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\n",
    " dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\n",
    " dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\n",
    " extremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1\n",
    " 3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n",
    " √\n",
    " dk \n",
    ".\n",
    " Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\n",
    " we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\n",
    " linear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\n",
    " queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\n",
    " 4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\n",
    " variables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = dk\n",
    " i=1 \n",
    "qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\n",
    " 4\n",
    "output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\n",
    " depicted in Figure 2.\n",
    " Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\n",
    " subspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\n",
    " MultiHead(Q,K,V ) = Concat(head1,...,headh)WO\n",
    " where headi = Attention(QWQ\n",
    " i ,KWK\n",
    " i ,VWV\n",
    " i )\n",
    " Where the projections are parameter matrices WQ\n",
    " i ∈Rdmodel× dk, WK\n",
    " i\n",
    " and WO ∈Rhdv×dmodel.\n",
    " ∈ Rdmodel×dk, WV\n",
    " i ∈ Rdmodel× dv\n",
    " In this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\n",
    " dk = dv =dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\n",
    " is similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\n",
    " 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n",
    " The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n",
    " • In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\n",
    " and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\n",
    " position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\n",
    " typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n",
    " [38, 2, 9].\n",
    " • The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\n",
    " and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\n",
    " encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\n",
    " encoder.\n",
    " • Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\n",
    " all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\n",
    " information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\n",
    " inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\n",
    " of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n",
    " 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n",
    " In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\n",
    " connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\n",
    " consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n",
    " FFN(x) = max(0,xW1 +b1)W2 +b2\n",
    " (2)\n",
    " While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\n",
    " from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\n",
    " The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\n",
    " dff = 2048.\n",
    " 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n",
    " Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\n",
    " tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor\n",
    "mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\n",
    " our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\n",
    " linear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\n",
    " 5\n",

    " Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\n",
    " order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\n",
    " tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\n",
    " bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\n",
    " as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\n",
    " learned and fixed [9].\n",
    " In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n",
    " PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\n",
    " PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\n",
    " where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\n",
    " corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\n",
    " chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\n",
    " relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\n",
    " PEpos.\n",
    " Wealso experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\n",
    " versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\n",
    " because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\n",
    " during training.\n",
    " 4 WhySelf-Attention\n",
    " In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu\n",
    "tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n",
    " (x1,..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,zn), with xi,zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\n",
    " layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\n",
    " consider three desiderata.\n",
    " One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\n",
    " be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n",
    " The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\n",
    " dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\n",
    " ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\n",
    " traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\n",
    " and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\n",
    " the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\n",
    " different layer types.\n",
    " Asnoted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\n",
    " executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\n",
    " computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n",
    " 6\n",
    "length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\n",
    " sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n",
    " [38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\n",
    " very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\n",
    " the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\n",
    " path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n",
    " Asingle convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\n",
    " positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\n",
    " or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\n",
    " between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\n",
    " recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\n",
    " considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\n",
    " convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\n",
    " the approach we take in our model.\n",
    " Asside benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\n",
    " from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\n",
    " heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\n",
    " and semantic structure of the sentences.\n",
    " 5 Training\n",
    " This section describes the training regime for our models.\n",
    " 5.1 Training Data and Batching\n",
    " We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\n",
    " sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source\n",
    "target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\n",
    " 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\n",
    " vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\n",
    " batch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\n",
    " target tokens.\n",
    " 5.2 Hardware and Schedule\n",
    " We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\n",
    " the hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\n",
    " trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\n",
    " bottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\n",
    " (3.5 days).\n",
    " 5.3 Optimizer\n",
    " Weused the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\n",
    " rate over the course of training, according to the formula:\n",
    " lrate = d−0.5\n",
    " model · min(step_num−0.5,step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\n",
    " (3)\n",
    " This corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\n",
    " and decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\n",
    " warmup_steps = 4000.\n",
    " 5.4 Regularization\n",

    " English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\n",

    " Weare excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\n",
    " plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\n",
    " to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\n",

    " Abstract\n",
    " The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or\n",

    " based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\n",
    " entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\n",
    " be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\n",
    " less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English\n",
    "to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\n",
    " ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\n",
    " our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\n",
    " training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\n",

    "1 Introduction\n",
    " Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks\n",
    " in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\n",
    " transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous\n",
    " efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\n",
    " architectures [38, 24, 15].\n",
    " Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\n",
    " sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\n",
    " states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\n",
    " sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\n",
    " sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\n",
    " significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\n",
    " computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\n",
    " constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n",
    " Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc\n",
    "tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\n",
    " the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\n",
    " are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n",
    " In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\n",
    " relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\n",
    " The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\n",
    " translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n",
    " 2 Background\n",
    " The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n",
    " [16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\n",
    " block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\n",
    " the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\n",
    " in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\n",
    " it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\n",
    " reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\n",
    " to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\n",
    " described in section 3.2.\n",
    " Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\n",
    " of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\n",
    " used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\n",
    " textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n",
    " End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence\n",
    "aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\n",
    " language modeling tasks [34].\n",
    " To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\n",
    " entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence\n",
    "aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\n",
    " self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n",
    " 3 ModelArchitecture\n",
    " Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\n",
    " Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,xn) to a sequence\n",
    " of continuous representations z = (z1,...,zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\n",
    " sequence (y1,...,ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n",
    " [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n",
    " 2\n",
    "Figure 1: The Transformer- model architecture.\n",
    " The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\n",
    " connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\n",
    " respectively.\n",
    " 3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n",
    " Encoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\n",
    " sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position\n",
    "wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\n",
    " the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\n",
    " LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\n",
    " itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\n",
    " layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\n",
    " Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\n",
    " sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\n",
    " attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\n",
    " around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\n",
    " sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\n",
    " masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\n",
    " predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n",
    " 3.2 Attention\n",
    " An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\n",
    " where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n",
    " 3\n",
    "Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n",
    " Multi-Head Attention\n",
    " Figure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\n",
    " attention layers running in parallel.\n",
    " of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\n",
    " query with the corresponding key.\n",
    " 3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\n",
    " We call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\n",
    " queries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\n",
    " query with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\n",
    " values.\n",
    " In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\n",
    " into a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\n",
    " the matrix of outputs as:\n",
    " Attention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT\n",
    " √\n",
    " dk \n",
    ")V\n",
    " (1)\n",
    " The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi\n",
    "√\n",
    " plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\n",
    " of 1\n",
    " dk \n",
    ". Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\n",

    " 3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\n",
    " The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n",
    " • In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\n",
    " and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\n",
    " position in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\n",
    " typical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\n",
    " [38, 2, 9].\n",
    " • The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\n",
    " and queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\n",
    " encoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\n",
    " encoder.\n",
    " • Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\n",
    " all positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\n",
    " information flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\n",
    " inside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\n",
    " of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n",
    " 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n",
    " In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\n",
    " connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\n",
    " consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n",
    " FFN(x) = max(0,xW1 +b1)W2 +b2\n",
    " (2)\n",
    " While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\n",
    " from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\n",
    " The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\n",
    " dff = 2048.\n",
    " 3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n",
    " Similarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\n",
    " tokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor\n",
    "mation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\n",
    " our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\n",

    " 3.5 Positional Encoding\n",
    " Since our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\n",
    " order of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\n",
    " tokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\n",
    " bottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\n",
    " as the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\n",
    " learned and fixed [9].\n",
    " In this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\n",
    " PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\n",
    " PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\n",
    " where pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\n",
    " corresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\n",
    " chose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\n",
    " relative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\n",
    " PEpos.\n",
    " Wealso experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\n",
    " versions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\n",
    " because it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\n",
    " during training.\n",
    " 4 WhySelf-Attention\n",
    " In this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu\n",
    "tional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\n",
    " (x1,..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,zn), with xi,zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\n",
    " layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\n",
    " consider three desiderata.\n",
    " One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\n",
    " be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n",
    " The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\n",
    " dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\n",
    " ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\n",
    " traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\n",
    " and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\n",
    " the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\n",
    " different layer types.\n",
    " Asnoted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\n",
    " executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\n",
    " computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n",
    " 6\n",
    "length n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\n",
    " sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n",
    " [38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\n",
    " very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\n",
    " the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\n",
    " path length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n",
    " Asingle convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\n",
    " positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\n",
    " or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\n",
    " between any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\n",
    " recurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\n",
    " considerably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\n",
    " convolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\n",
    " the approach we take in our model.\n",
    " Asside benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\n",
    " from our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\n",
    " heads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\n",
    " and semantic structure of the sentences.\n",
    " 5 Training\n",
    " This section describes the training regime for our models.\n",
    " 5.1 Training Data and Batching\n",
    " We trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\n",
    " sentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source\n",

    " 2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\n",
    " vocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\n",

    " target tokens.\n",
    " 5.2 Hardware and Schedule\n",
    " We trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\n",

    " trained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\n",

    " (3.5 days).\n",
    " 5.3 Optimizer\n",
    " Weused the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\n",

    " lrate = d−0.5\n",
    " model · min(step_num−0.5,step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\n",
    " (3)\n",

It discusses how models prioritize different aspects of captions depending on their intended use case.\\n\\n**Specific Area of AI:**\\n\\n* **Multimodal Learning and Pre-training:** The paper focuses on multimodal learning and pre-training techniques, particularly zero-shot classification models that require high accuracy but also rich text descriptions from visual data.\\n\\n**Key Findings (3-4 lines)**\\n\\nThe authors find that balancing richness and accuracy in captions is crucial for multimodal tasks. They identify two primary trade-offs: richer captions with more details but lower factual accuracy (e.g., SSC), and shorter captions with higher accuracy but lower detail (e.g., DSC+). The results show that models pre-trained with hallucinations (minor inaccuracies) tend to perform better in complex vision-language reasoning tasks.\\n\\n**Real-World Deployment Implications**\\n\\nThe findings have implications for real-world deployment, as they suggest that models pre-trained with a balance of richness and accuracy can be effective for zero-shot classification applications. However, the authors caution that the benefits may vary depending on the specific task or use case, emphasizing the need to carefully evaluate model performance on a diverse set of benchmarks.\\n\\n**Additional Insights**\\n\\nThe paper also highlights the importance of fine-tuning pre-trained models with limited training data and provides insights into how to balance richness and accuracy in captions for multimodal tasks.',\n",

      "--- SUMMARY ---\n",
      "The paper explores the trade-off between caption richness and accuracy for multimodal tasks, specifically in models pre-trained with zero-shot classification applications. It discusses how models prioritize different aspects of captions depending on their intended use case.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- AREA ---\n",
      "Multimodal Learning and Pre-training: The paper focuses on multimodal learning and pre-training techniques, particularly zero-shot classification models that require high accuracy but also rich text descriptions from visual data.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- FINDINGS ---\n",
      "The authors find that balancing richness and accuracy in captions is crucial for multimodal tasks. They identify two primary trade-offs: richer captions with more details but lower factual accuracy (e.g., SSC), and shorter captions with higher accuracy but lower detail (e.g., DSC+). The results show that models pre-trained with hallucinations (minor inaccuracies) tend to perform better in complex vision-language reasoning tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "--- REAL ---\n",
      "The findings have implications for real-world deployment, as they suggest that models pre-trained with a balance of richness and accuracy can be effective for zero-shot classification applications. However, the authors caution that the benefits may vary depending on the specific task or use case, emphasizing the need to carefully evaluate model performance on a diverse set of benchmarks.\n",
